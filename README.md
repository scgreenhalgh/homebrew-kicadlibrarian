# Homebrew-kicadlibrarian

Updated to the latest version and using metacollin's wx31 and patches.  Sorry this took so long I've been busy.

## Installation

Installation is simple and much like any other tap, but please read the next section carefully first.
```sh
brew tap shaneburrell/kicadlibrarian
brew install --HEAD kicadlibrarian

Run from terminal by issueding kicadlibrarian command. 
```
