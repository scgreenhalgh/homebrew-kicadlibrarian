# Homebrew-kicadlibrarian

Under Development!!!

## Installation

Installation is simple and much like any other tap, but please read the next section carefully first.  There are certain options you may wish to enable or disable.  Once you're sure, go head and:
```sh
brew tap shaneburrell/kicadlibrarian
brew install kicadlibrarian
```


NOTE: This will have to be run interactively at the moment and some error ignored!
